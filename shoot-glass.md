# Shoot Glass

By default, this mod only covers the vanilla glass blocks, but modded blocks can be easily by a data pack to the mods `breakable_blocks` [tag](https://github.com/AzureDoom/Shoot-Glass/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/resources/data/shootglass/tags/blocks/breakable\_blocks.json) so you can add in any other block as well!
