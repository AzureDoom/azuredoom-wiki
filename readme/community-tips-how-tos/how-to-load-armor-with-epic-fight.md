# How to load Armor with Epic Fight

Please note the custom animations on your armor are not supported in this format change.

Please review the [Getting Started with Blender Guide](https://epicfight-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Guides/page3/) the Epic Fight dev provided to get the basics of Blender out of the way for this guide.

In BlockBench with your Armor model open, simply go to `File` -> `Export` -> `Export OBJ Model`

Once you have exported the model, follow the steps starting [HERE](https://epicfight-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Armor/3Darmor\_page1/#weight-paint-and-vertex-correction) in the guide provided by the Epic Fight dev.
